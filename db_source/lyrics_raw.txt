This is a story about a dog.
The dog like most dogs, was a puppy at one time
This was a cute puppy.
The puppy had a master, a human, as you could call it, i suppose.
The human was kind of unattractive.
The dog was cute.
The dog was the master of the person.
So what's up with that, right?
The dog had to do something.
Something had to be done.
So what did it do? what did it do?
I'll tell you what it did.
It climbed up on the kitchen counter
on top of the kitchen counter on top of the shelves, where all the spices were
and got some rosemary
and it baked itself a cake
with just rosemary.
when the human came home
it wanted the cake
it turns out that rosemary is deadly to humans
it died
the person died
the dog won the war. the end. fade out. a little bit more. now we're done.
sitting in the garage, looking under the hood
gonna put in some oil, then this black guy came in
he didn't have any hair, he did have some boots
and a red flame guitar, and he was a total badass
cuz its a rockstar retreat
and there's a lincoln zepher in the garage
and mike cameron, holy shit
sitting here in jail, cuz i killed a blue whale

bill hall and ricky weeks
kittys put his spaceboots on again
looks like he'll be going as far as he can
he'll leave the world and all his dreams behind
to become another cat in space
a cat in space is like a rhino in the zoo
except there are no fences out in space
imagine you're a man set on fire
out in space you would not be on fire
and i won't lie to you
you're kinda cute thats all, we should hook up later on
and don't lie to me
my cat is out in space, and i love you
a rocket goes and gets the captain back
turns out he is wanted for some shit
he baked his master a happy birthday cake
he only used rosemary to bake the cake
a little hillside village is where it all began
a man left home seraching
for an answer to his life long plan
he had a woman on his mind
who made his pants explode
he wanted her she laughed at him,
he knew where he must go
wicked doc voodoo took him in took him in
he put him in a bomback, shot shit out his back
but turns out doc voodoo was a slimy little whore
his pink limosine will burn forever more
white dwarf coming for your ass
more armor will not stop your death
the asphalt stained wiht your fallen blood
red asphalt cheaters never win
bone daddy, bone daddy, i'm a human being
get your fucking ass fire off of my car
long face lou, how do you do?
i'll tell you how i do, i kill you
billy mays sold me on everything,
he sold me everything that i'd ever need
he sold me a pinball machine, and oxyclean,
he sold me socks and boots, and some high class booze
when you need something call on billy mays,
he'll hook you up so fat, with a chesire cat
cuz he's a motherfucking badass with his blue tattoos,
he'll sell you rubber gloves and a meatball sub
he's a demon android gargoyle vampire high class prick
he sold our souls, shit makes me sick
he's a tempress cleopatra smooth exploding dick
he'll meet you on your TV, your pop-up ads,
he'll host your radio shows, great you at lowes
you can't even breath without breathing mays,
we love you so much, we need you to stay
you killed my friends, and i'm left here
i don't know you, i don't know you
you left me here all alone, all alone
puking behind the church at a quarter to noon
i'd love to put my buttsteak in you
think of all the fun we could have
i'd love to put my buttsteak in you
until we are unable to stand
puking behind the church at a quarter to one
i see your face shawty and i want a gun
i never wanna see you cry again
six easy steps and i'm able to win
awake,
the child beneath me now sings,
as the endeavors of my past have now
sunken to the dark depths of the sea
emerge,
another day beckons against the wind,
but follow me not for i have foresaken
the righteous path of benevolence
arise,
as the hour of opportunity drawns near
and the hand of fate extends in a
gesture of forgotten solitude
deliver,
the rusted sands to the sacred oblisk
before the augmentation of the undead
reaches the bowels of reality
a lone child,
who happens to be a boy,
caresses his passion for death
a death that releases his anguish
and bringsnow light to his revelation
orion, hunter of the snake,
contemplates the existence of his only true foe,
the prince of chaos
he sends his army of flight
swooping down to the abyss of an endless prosperity
and what emerges is a wereloon,
a condesnation of both a coyote and a loon
its talons are awesome,
the talons are made of fire
and the fur hurts a lot when you touch it
hey hey let’s drink some whiskey
hey hey don’t touch me there
hey hey let’s drink some whiskey
there’s a douchebag over there
who’s that guy on you?
what’s he doing here?
i’m creeping through the window
he told me to fuck myself
butcher my senses and i’ll butcher your face
watch as it juices all over the place
he flicked me off but here’s the truth
i’ve got some whiskey for you
i’ve got a phone and
it ringes sometimes
i threw my phone and
now that shit’s fucking broke
hey hey let’s drink some whiskey
hey hey don’t touch my dick
hey hey let’s drink some whiskey
go ahead and touch my dick
i’d never want to live in antarctica
shit there never goes my way
whenever i’m in antarctica
i end up having a really bad day
one time when i was in antarctica
with the hunnies at the local bar
this dude came up and broke my back
that day really fucking sucked
one time i went to antarctica
cuz i wanted to have a good time
i tripped over a tree and looked real dumb
i usually don’t do shit like that
last may i was in antarctica
meeting up with some long lost friends
we started to play kick the can
and i lost
i’d never want to live in antarctica
even though i’ve been there 53 times
everytime is worst than the last
except when i didn’t get stabbed
sometimes i go to antarctica
to party round the clock
but last time i was there i fell asleep
at like 10
sometimes i got to antarctica
to relax after a shitty day
i’ll order a whiskey old fashioned
but it’s barley mudled at all
i’d never wanna live in antarctica
because they have roundabouts
i fucking hate roundabouts
antartica’s a god place to go
if you like eating shit for brunch
they have it there all the time
but the sides are usually extra
one time when i was in antarctica
volunteering at a kindergarden
all the kids made fun of me
because i was in antarctica
shining bright against the night
you were there and i felt right
the walls came down all around
and then i heard you sing
i was stuck inside of you
i felt warm i felt you too
now i see i saw your face
there’s always time to be afraid
and when we were scared we climbed the stairs
higher than we had ever prepared
i reached for your but you withdrew, so i fly away
you were the last book i had to read
the story of my life for all to see
the ending was wrong but felt so right, so i fly away
monday night is at your door
it makes you want a little more
i have a little more for you
close your eyes and dreams come true
you don’t know what you know
you don’t know anything
you dont’ know why you’re gone
and why you won’t ever come back
i know what you’re thinking last night
it was a fairytale filled with dolls
now i’m playing with a loaded gun
sometimes i eat pancakes at ten o’clock
it’s really kinda late cuz that’s at night
you’d think it was in the morning
but it was at night
sometimes i go to the desert
sometimes i don’t
jelly for the sandwiches
my mom was making
for the party
at the hopsotch forest
in the middle of the night
young children
and four bags
of sleeping powder
so they will not know that
i am
a man they should not trust
is sleeping
behind the broken window
by the drunken slot machine
well, show me the way to
the next whiskey bar
oh don't ask why
for if we don't find
the next whiskey bar
tell you we must die
oh moon of alabama
we now must say goodbye
we've lost our good old mama
and must have whiskey oh you know why
was gonna be an actor
was gonna be a star
wanted to make the money
wanted to fill up my jar
then the vacuum spoke to me
my hoover was a sign from god
i’d ride it straight to happines
fuck all that shish kabob
so slap me over and spin me round
if you buy this vacuum
i promise they won’t ever hear a sound
you can count on me to be the one
to kill you quickly
and change the bag when you are done
vacuum on a sunday
vacuum your life away
vacuum till your last breath
vacuum you to death
vacuum vacuum hell yeah!
vacuum you down a well
vacuum you straight to hell
vacuum you missed that spot
vacuum you got it
and i’m the only one
i am what i’ve become
your carpet is nice and clean
finally i can breath
finally i can be
there’s only one more fee
the vacuum is the key
outside on a sunday
grass green on both my feet
frisbee flies far and so high
(i hate turk and i hate you)
front yard is where we play
all day all we do is wait
for a chance to be your friend
(i hate turk and i hate you)
nobody you’re my least favorite nobody
stukenberg why be that way
i love you and turk does too
let’s be friends and play everyday
(i hate turk and i hate you)
if you don’t want to play
our band will beat your’s everyday
that’s not true i fucking suck
(i hate turk and i hate you)
pete is my brother i love him and he loves me
we’re always together except when we’re apart
pete is my brother but make no mistake
when it comes to friends i have shit tons more
i am singing, this whole song
and i’m beautiful
turk and rich are perfect they are my best friends
they like me more than they like you pete
you think that i’m wrong but here’s the thing
that you don’t know rich wrote this song
i am swinging, on a swing and i fell
now i’m sitting on the ground and i’m beautiful
marykate i’d like to take a match and melt off all your clothes
then i’d like to see your smile disappear beneath my belt
i stumble through your crude arrangement
little grief to your amazement
i hear you telling me that it is not fair
across the room from me you give me your glare
it was so hot that day
all i wanted was a little breeze
but the window the window
came crashing down
the pain window the pain window window pain
prove to me you’re really never there
my heart bleeds a thousand times for you
there you are again sitting on the bench
in the park with your hands
i see you everyday i see you everday
but i never have known just what to say
there you are again, this time i’m prepared
to make a move, check these moves
i talk about some wildlife, mention the ozone,
photosynthesis, and the ocean, flock of geese, diversity
cuz ladies love a man who’s in love with the land
she’ll love you nice and deep if global warming makes you weep
so my advice to you plant a plan or maybe two
and when she mentions pesticides say you don’t like pesticides
there you again you’re wearing your high heels
time for me to seal the deal
you’re talking about some movie
i say fuck that what about invasive species that shit sucks
cuz ladies love a man who can talk about the land
and if that’s all it takes you can fake it for one date
say you’re going green and you don’t like to dryclean
or at the very least pretened you don’t eat meat
in the park
babies laugh, babies cry
can’t you see, we’re meant to be
i was on a honeymoon at a hospital
i was on the sun going nowhere
i was singing hello to the men at war
i was taking classes to learn to soar
i was peeking over the berlin wall
i was unsure if i should try to fall
i was with some babies up in heaven
i was in the mall buying a brand new skirt
slooby when you stand there, overalanding
i can’t be right beside you, borando
deramona is what deramona does
follow this town gray’s the new brown
i was in the sea catching all the waves
i was down below all alone
i was the first one to see you come in last
i was drinking whiskey way too fast
i was hunkering down for the lonley night
i was watching the tornado pass on by
i was partying with the viet cong
i was helping me to write this song
they are here, watch your back
contract, with the dead
save me, from myself,
gray is the new brown
there once was a time when food was an afterthought
an expected commodity, the years of plenty
but nothing’s constant except change
a reality that can be a tough pill to swallow
the end came faster than could have been imagined
the land dried up, the earth lay bare
refusing to grow as much as a blade a grass
these were dark times, humanity was dying
along with its will to live
on the brink of extinction a young women stumbled home
cold and alone, dragging her net behind her as she crept
little did she know she had a caught a phantom, a ghost
once home she prepared what was to be her last meal
a few strips of bacon she had stored away
for her glorious exit from the world
but the world was about to change forever
from the corner of her eye she caught a glimpse
of the phantom still caught in her net
panicked she beat it with her club
she fried the phantom in the bacon grease
and prepared for the afterlife
but two weeks later she felt better than ever
strong, confident, phantom power
cuz i’m a phantom
and you’re a phantom
let’s phantom together
let’s phantom right now
cuz i’m a phantom
and you’re a phantom
let’s do the phantom
let’s do it right now
phantoms are the only thing you need
phantoms and a little bacon grease
get away from my toys, hop out of my ditch
never do any work, why are you such a jerk?
making a mess of my stuff, you wear my mothers lace
cuties all over the ground, you are such a stupid face
my daddy doesn't like you, he thinks that you're dumb
you can't come over, and you can't have fun
i freaking hate you, you are quite fat
eat poo, and brocolli, eat a big ol rat
please be my jerk
always a jerk
horny men jerk
now the cone standing alone on the corner of the avenue,
meets a man just walking home past the gutter that flows into
storm drain is full tonight and the man is shaking hands,
then the woman says something like 'im actually a man'
he stands still for a moment, he's unsure of what to do,
he runs to the basement, locks himself up in a room
he was searching for a sound solution, searching as time went by,
he was searching for a little more, in the end came no reply
alone never meant much to the white stripe on the road,
he was meant to look up at her like somebody he'd like to know
dirt stains upon his face, the warmth slowly subsides,
he's helpless for a moment and the cone has never lied
reply to the answer, make time for the game,
wait until tomorrow for what he asks of you today
beaches of spring break were filled with legs
the two of mine, both were fake
although i was different i still fit in
until one morning on a run i went
off by myself down on the beach
a dog ran up and he barked at me
bit my leg off in pain i screamed
my ugly stump was all that i could see
took my other leg right off of my hip
hit the dog with no mercy at all
tired i sat down on the beach
when a wave came up, took my legs away from me
i lost my legs while on spring break
washed out to sea, far away from me
now i can't walk, run or stand
my friends left me here trapped in the sand
and everyday i hope that this is fake
cuz i lost my legs while on spring break
without my legs i'm nothing at all i can't move,
all i do is fall
could someone please come and help
i'd come to you but i can't move
be my friend, i need one now
just a friend, and not a cow
rent a friend, is what i need
someone to buy, who will never leave
play with me, all summer long
they let me win, i sing a song
i am friendless and i'll admit it
but i need someone to hold my hand
as i cross the street right in front of you
i'm lonlier than i began
always be there, is all i ask
never leave, or ill attack
i don't care, if you are fat
shattering your ball and chain,
walking through the stormy rain
the devil is your only foe,
under the lightning lying low
she breathes the fire and the smoke,
laughs at her lifeless joke
sprints across the land at large,
shoves a javeline through his heart
going back into the ground,
nothing but a muddy mound
screaming at the digging men,
who shovel, pack and dig again
don't hear your mumbles or your words,
but keep you alive in your grave
ghosts of the dead still roam,
to feed their empty hearts and bones
then back to hell they fly,
emptiness beneath the sky
the suffered reach their hands up high,
weak break down stutter and cry
cast deep into their beds
to become the newly made dead
roll in my sleep im awakened to find,
you in my room, my window is high
i wanted to see how it is that you sleep,
passed out in bed your finger tips red
i shout at the door, 'see me no more'
leave how you came my face full of shame
clothes in the air i float far away,
i'll be back tomorrow, boy i'm here to stay
night prowler, don't think i could live with the day
tomorrow, she'll wonder on in looking to stay
when you return ready i'll wait,
crouched in the corner all you can do is wait
please don't be mean, i love you, its true,
watching you sleep alone in your room
why can't you see it's creepy to me
to have you here above like a flea
a flea that's infested with you on its mind,
you are my flower, the prettiest kind
girl i'll kill you
but first i'll kiss you
please leave and mean it
no. i'm here to stay
footprints embedded, a sign to refuse
shaking the hollow, the darkening news
extending too far, don't understand why
rewrite the ending before i can fly
poisonous posture reminds it to stay
pass it around and give it away
follow the red lines to the back of your hand
veins exploding as you do it again
you say you want the world you always want more
so follow it through the last open door
believe all the simple lies don't think to ignore
be the last one to step through the door
under the floor shadows too near
lift a finger to save a tear
the constellation runs deep and thin
and as it flows it becomes sin
i am a monkey, look at me go
i like bananas, snow snow snow
markers can draw and so can i
wheels can turn and you can die
money in the form of spoons, killing something something soon
always wanting something new, summer job in a funeral home
friends call me fago, the faggiest one
but they don't know that i have a gun
aliens in the sky? i have to pee
letters and numbers, i still have to pee
pet rocks pack quite a bite, bite like a knife in winter
a single ship goes out to sea
i fell tonight and broke my knee
owls at night do scare me
but big pillows are very comfy
we really arn't. well, i'm not. turk is.
