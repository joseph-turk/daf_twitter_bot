0143	There once was a time when food was an afterthought, an expected commodity. The years of plenty.	Phantom Power	Gypsy Moth	2012
0144	Nothing is constant except change. A reality that can be a tough pill to swallow.	Phantom Power	Gypsy Moth	2012
0145	The end came faster than could have been imagined. The land dried up. The earth lay bare, refusing to grow as much as a blade a grass.	Phantom Power	Gypsy Moth	2012
0146	These were dark times. Humanity was dying, along with its will to live.	Phantom Power	Gypsy Moth	2012
0147	On the brink of extinction, a young women stumbled home, cold and alone, dragging her net behind her as she crept.	Phantom Power	Gypsy Moth	2012

0150	The world was about to change forever.	Phantom Power	Gypsy Moth	2012
0151	From the corner of her eye she caught a glimpse of the phantom still caught in her net. Panicked, she beat it with her club.	Phantom Power	Gypsy Moth	2012
0152	She fried the phantom in the bacon grease, and prepared for the afterlife.	Phantom Power	Gypsy Moth	2012
0153	Two weeks later, she felt better than ever. Strong. Confident. Phantom power.	Phantom Power	Gypsy Moth	2012
0154	I'm a phantom, and you’re a phantom. Let’s phantom together. Let’s phantom right now.	Phantom Power	Gypsy Moth	2012
0155	I'm a phantom, and you’re a phantom. Let’s do the phantom. Let’s do it right now.	Phantom Power	Gypsy Moth	2012

0165	Now the cone standing alone on the corner of the avenue meets a man just walking home past the gutter.	Sound Solution	Shadowland	2006
0166	"Storm drain is full tonight and the man is shaking hands. Then the woman says something like ""I'm actually a man."""	Sound Solution	Shadowland	2006
0167	He stands still for a moment. He's unsure of what to do. He runs to the basement. Locks himself up in a room.	Sound Solution	Shadowland	2006
0168	He was searching for a sound solution, searching as time went by. He was searching for a little more. In the end came no reply.	Sound Solution	Shadowland	2006
0169	Alone never meant much to the white stripe on the road. He was meant to look up at her like somebody he'd like to know.	Sound Solution	Shadowland	2006
0170	Dirt stains upon his face, the warmth slowly subsides. He's helpless for a moment and the cone has never lied.	Sound Solution	Shadowland	2006
0171	Reply to the answer, make time for the game. Wait until tomorrow for what he asks of you today.	Sound Solution	Shadowland	2006

0179	Everyday I hope that this is fake cause I lost my legs while on spring break.	I Lost My Legs on Spring Break	Shadowland	2006
0180	Without my legs I'm nothing at all. I can't move, all I do is fall.	I Lost My Legs on Spring Break	Shadowland	2006
